### Prototype

Our project is a browser extension that can automatically generate alt text when the page is loaded. For example, a user will install the extension from the store and configure settings such as language and toggle automatic caption generation. Once the page is loaded, the extension can detect images that do not have alt text. The extension invokes a serverless function that calls the Azure Image description API. If the user's settings are not English, the process will also contact the Azure Cognitive Services Translator to match the user's language preferences. Since we want to converse resources if a page has many images, there is a limit of five captions generated on page load. Users can click the "Generate alt text" option in the context manager to create more captions if they want more.
