### Problem

Alternate text is an attribute embedded in digital content, such as a web page or PDF, that describes a photo or graphic. As such, alt text is critical for those with disabilities because it represents the function and appearance of a picture or drawing they cannot see. People who publish images to the Internet frequently do not include alt text, making these images incomprehensible for those relying on screen readers or with poor Internet connectivity. According to the Twitter accessibility team, only .06% of images on its website are accessible. We hope to improve the status quo of missing alt text on the Internet through our solution. Our mission is to make the Internet more inclusive by effortlessly receiving alt text on the user's end.
