### Identification

We brainstormed multiple possible solutions to this problem. There are two main ways to approach this problem. First, we can ask the author or developer to provide alt text when uploading an image to the Internet. We thought of several ideas: a GitHub bot that checks for invalid alt text on images and a browser extension to remind Twitter users to add alt text. However, not all people understand the importance of alt text to people with visual impairments, so that they won't provide a caption. So, we devised a solution that works even when the alt text is empty. Our project will be a browser extension describing an image without alt-text. The user can hover over a photo and get a description of the image on a tooltip. The implemented solution will work with screen readers by replacing alt text with the generated caption when the page loads.
